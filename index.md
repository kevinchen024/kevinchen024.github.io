_**[SP24-SCM354-Penske Project](Penske Project.pdf)**_

My goal: 
1. Assess training duration (60-90 days) for optimal productivity and lower turnover.
   
2. Evaluate training timeline variations across locations for standardization or customization.

3. Analyze the link between training length and turnover to minimize attrition.

4. Identify training delays by location to enhance performance and efficiency.
